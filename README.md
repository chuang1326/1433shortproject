# 1433shortproject

Run 1433paper1.do in the same folder as cleaned_OI_state_data.csv and cyberstates_data.csv to obtain the results.
You will need to change the directory in the Stata code for the file to run.
I created cyberstates_data.csv using the interactive map at https://www.cyberstates.org.
